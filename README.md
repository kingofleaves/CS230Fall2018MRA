Automated Diagnostic Classification of Pediatric MR Angiography Using Deep Learning

Cerebrovascular diseases are an important cause of mortality and morbidity within the pediatric population, and effective treatment depends on accurate and efficient diagnosis. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive technology that allows visualization of the vasculature of the pediatric brain without necessitating exposure to radiation, and is an important diagnostic imaging tool used for evaluating suspected cerebrovascular disease in children. However, due to complex developmental changes of the brain and skull, interpretation of pediatric MRA remains an enormous challenge for most clinicians and a source of significant burden for physicians who often confront life-threatening events that require immediate diagnosis and decision-making. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more efficient and accurate diagnostic decision support for pediatric MRA. We propose to apply deep-learning methodologies to develop a classifier model to (1) distinguish normal versus abnormal MRA and (2) further differentiate across the five core diagnostic classes of pediatric cerebrovascular disease. When successful, our innovative application of deep learning to pediatric MRA interpretation will serve as the foundation for creating a novel computer-aid diagnostic support system that can be integrated into current imaging platforms to provide accurate, real-time clinical decision support.
